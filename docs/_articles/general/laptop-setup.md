## Laptop Setup Instructions

To participate in the workshop, you will need access to the software described below. You will also need an up-to-date web browser.

### Text Editor

You will need a text editor in order to work with Processing. Any editor you can write text on will do, but I will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you feel more comfortable using a different editor, that's ok too! 

### p5.js Library 

We will be using p5.js for this workshop. Feel free to explore the [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) before you come to class (but don't worry if you don't have time). You should also download the library from this [link](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/releases/download/v1.4.2/p5.zip`) and save the downloaded folder somewhere on your laptop. 

### Local Server

After downloading the library, you need to set up a local server. If you're using Visual Studio Code as your text editor, you can easily install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Navigate to the Extensions manager view by hitting Ctrl+Shift+X, then search for Live Server and select Install. When you restart Visual Studio Code, there should be a little "Go Live" button at the bottom right of your window. 

If you're using an alternative text editor, there are instructions for setting up a local server [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).
