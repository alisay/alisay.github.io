## 1: Topic introduction
- Looking at location-based artworks.  
- What are some examples?

    - [Little Frank and His Carp](https://vimeo.com/56939001), Andrea Fraser
    - [Secret City](http://www.benmoren.com/projects/secret-city)
    - [Deviator](https://pvicollective.com/project/deviator/)
- [Template project](https://github.com/alisay/alisay.github.io/raw/main/docs/_articles/module-5/testLocation.zip)

## 2: Hands-on and material exploration
- Walk around VAC with a notebook. 
    - Make a note of interesting locations and record the latitude/longitude and a short description. Start thinking about what you might like to see at each location.
    - Think about a general concept for the work. Flesh it out on paper: 
        - What will you see/hear/do at each location?
        - How will people know how to find the location? Will there be a map or directions? Will it be serendipity? 
        - Begin to sketch each location in code. You can make a separate sketch for each. 

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity

### Final Crit
- Feedback and discussion on work created so far. 

### Feedback on workshop
- Quick survey and informal discussion.

### Where to from here?
