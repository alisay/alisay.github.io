## 1: Topic introduction

- Introduce yourself, why this workshop?
- Quick survey on past experience.
- Workshop overview/objectives and introduction to materials. 

## 2: Hands-on and material exploration

### Instructions for drawing:
- Break into partners. 
- As a team, devise a set of instructions to create a drawing. 
- Write out the instructions on paper provided.
- Switch instructions with another pair. 
- You create a drawing based on their instructions, and they create a drawing based on yours.

### Introduction to p5.js
- Open the [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
- What are we looking up? What is the difference between `setup()` and `draw()`?
- Try using some of the following lines of code in each place to figure it out. What does each line do?
    - `createCanvas(w, h);`
    - `ellipse(x, y, w, h);`
    - `rect(x, y, w, h);`
    - `line(x1, y1, x2, y2);`
    - `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3);`
    - `fill(g);`
    - `fill(r, g, b, a);`
    - `stroke(r, g, b, a);`
    - `strokeWeight(weight);`
    - `background(r, g, b, a);`
    - `print(s);`
    - The two below get put inside of other functions above, as replacements for the letters
    - `random(max)`
    - `second()`

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity

What is computational art?
- Can you think of some examples you have enjoyed?
- What do these examples have in common?
- How does this relate to what we are doing?

## 4: Wrap-up and week ahead
- What did we learn ?
- Where are we going?

### Homework
- Bring in an object you find in your home or the area nearby.
