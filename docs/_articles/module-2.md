## 1: Topic introduction

- Recap yesterday. 
- Intro to the [docs](https://p5js.org/reference/).
- Drawing examples to walk through together: [download](https://github.com/alisay/p5-workshop/raw/master/01_drawing/01_drawing.zip).
- Variables and animation examples: [download](https://github.com/alisay/p5-workshop/raw/master/02_variables_animation/02_variables_animation.zip).

## 2: Hands-on and material exploration

- Replicate your object in code. It can be as realistic or abstract as you prefer. 
- Can you add one element that is different every time you reload the sketch?
- Can you add one element that changes when you move the mouse?

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity

### Crit session 0
- Share and discuss sketches.

### Play and Games
- Game designers create worlds and design temporary selves. 
- By setting the motivation and abilities of the players in the game, they create certain forms of agency. 
- Games offer distinctive aesthetic value: supporting the aesthetic experience of deciding and doing. 
- When we play games, our agency is fluid. We take on temporary ends and submerge ourselves in an alternate identity. 
- Games are a vessel for communication, writing and storing modes of agency: an archive. 
- By playing game, we familiarise ourselves with this archive and gain the capacity to change our own style of agency. 
- Games can function as critical, utopian tools, inspiring shifts in thinking and political orientation.
- Games can blur the boundaries between the contingency of play and the irrevocable seriousness of “real life”.

### Brainstorm games
- Come up with a simple single player game. Try to keep the mechanic and interaction as simple as possible to start out. 
- Using paper and pens, make a prototype or storyboard.
- Mechanics
    - What is the goal? What does the player do?
    - How do you win or finish? 
- Details
    - How do you detect if the player is achieving the goal?
    - How do you communicate to the player how they are doing?
    - Are there different states? Playing mode/game over? Levels? 
    - Does the game involve timing?
    - What are the smaller problems you need work through to tackle the bigger problem?

## 4: Wrap-up and next session
- Tomorrow: looking at logic. 

### Homework
- If you have time, think about adding an element of interaction to your sketch.
