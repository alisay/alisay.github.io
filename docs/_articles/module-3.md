## 1: Topic introduction
- Review 
- Looking at logic. Download examples [here](https://github.com/alisay/p5-workshop/raw/master/04_logic/04_logic.zip).

## 2: Hands-on and material exploration

- In pairs, make inverse programs. 
- Add an element of timing to the object you made yesterday.
- Interactivity: can you make a sketch with two inputs? 
    - E.g. a rollover button and a clickable button, or a keypress and a mouse click.

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity

### Brainstorm games
- Come up with a simple single player game. Try to keep the mechanic and interaction as simple as possible to start out. 
- Using paper and pens, make a prototype or storyboard.
- Mechanics
    - What is the goal? What does the player do?
    - How do you win or finish? 
- Details
    - How do you detect if the player is achieving the goal?
    - How do you communicate to the player how they are doing?
    - Are there different states? Playing mode/game over? Levels? 
    - Does the game involve timing?
    - What are the smaller problems you need work through to tackle the bigger problem?
