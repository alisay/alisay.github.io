			> "The adoption of chance had yet another purpose, a secret one. This was to restore to the work of art its primeval magic power ... By appealing directly to the unconscious, which is part and parcel of chance, we sought to restore to the work of art something of
			the numinous quality of which art has been the vehicle since time immemorial..."
			.footnote[_Hans Arp, Collage with Squares Arranged According to the Laws of Chance, 1916-17_ ]
