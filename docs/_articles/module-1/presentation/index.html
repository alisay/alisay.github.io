			# About this workshop series

			---

			# Who made this?

			I am a curator from regional WA, working voluntarily to build communities of interest around computational art. 

			Over the course of five workshops, we will:
			- gain familiarity with basic programming concepts. 
			- create simple visuals, as well as integrating video, sound, sensors and mobile devices.
			- understand and reflect on the social and political contexts in which these technologies are embedded.
			
			This syllabus is based on materials from many open-source projects, referenced in individual course modules, but especially from the [Processing Foundation Education Portal](https://processingfoundation.org/education) and [Toronto Mesh](https://tomesh.net).

			This project has been assisted by the Vancouver Arts Centre Supported Workshop Program and the Australian Government through the Australia Council for the Arts, its arts funding and advisory body.

			# Activity

			- Break into partners. 
			- As a team, devise a set of instructions to create a drawing. Write out the instructions on paper provided.
			- Switch instructions with another pair. You create a drawing based on their instructions, and they create a drawing based on yours.

			# Investigating p5.js

			- Open the [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
			- What are we looking up? What is the difference between `setup()` and `draw()`?
			- Try using some of [these lines of code](https://github.com/alisay/alisay.github.io/tree/main/docs/_articles/module-1/commands.md) to figure it out.

			# Wrap-up & Homework

			---

			# Recap

			- Discussed the meaning of computation in the context of art.
			- Practiced writing instructions for a machine. 
			- Touched upon the basics of p5.js

			_Questions?_

			---

			# Homework

			Next session we will dive into using p5.js, exploring variables and interaction. 
			- Stay behind if you need help getting set up on your local machine. 
			- Go for a stroll in your local area and find an object to bring tomorrow.
