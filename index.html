        <h1>Computation as Creative Practice</h1>
        <p>This workshop introduces novice coders to basic programming concepts, algorithmic approaches to digital
            design and modelling, and strategies for employing these in artistic practice.

            This is an opportunity for artists and anyone else with an interest in computational art to learn to write
            code and explore your practice in collaboration with other like-minded peers.
